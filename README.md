# BankProject
Together with two other colleagues, we have realized this project in Java, and the database being in MySQL. The project consists in simulating some functionalities of the banking application. So, having the user type: customer, admin or employee, we made a menu for each with different functionalities. For example, a customer can make transfers, access transaction history, create or liquidate deposits and add favourite people to his account. The admin has to approve liquidations and certain transactions, and the employee will maintain these actions, changes or other features.
